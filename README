This tool let you know, in a workbench window, what typedef are available
at the desired font. It must be run from cli, getting as argument, the full
path to the TTFont.

I wrote this little tool to be able to load a ttfont from dopus4 quickly,
and then check his style and the following characters:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789[\]!"#$%&'()*+×¿
./:;<=>?@^_-{|}~¡¬«¢¥¦§¨ªß
©®¯°±²³´µ¶·¸¹º»¼½¾¿ÂÃÄÅÆÇÈ
ÉÊËÌÍÎÏĞÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜİŞßà£¤


To config DOpus4, you only need create/edit a new class and then enter:

Name: TrueTypeFont	ID: TTF		Match: $00010000

and, on Double-Click: AmigaDos TTFViewer {f}
(as you, for sure, know ;)


thats all,
I hope this tool can be useful for someone..
